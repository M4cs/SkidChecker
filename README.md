# SkidChecker
A lightweight, multi-platform, proxyless Fortnite Skin/Account Checker.

Developed by Macs and Moriarty.

 ## What is SkidChecker?
 SkidChecker is a project of mine and Moriarty's to create a faster, lighter, and widely available Fortnite Skin Checker. Almost all Checkers are written in C# which limits these tools to just Windows machines. SkidChecker is written in Python which allows it to be deployed across MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
 
 ## Features:
   - Pull AccountID
   - Pull ClientID
   - Read Inventory (incl. Skins, Pickaxes, Glider, Backbling)
   - Read Statistics (incl. Seasons Played, Lifetime Wins, Kills, Account Level,
   Battle Pass tier, Season Level)
   - Account Activity Checker (check Last Played and Date Account was created)
   
 ## Requirements:
 
   - Python 2.7
   - Tor
   - A Combolist
   
   This program makes use of public API in order to check for account details.
 ## What makes SkidChecker different than other checkers?
  As far as we know this is the first of it's kind. There are no other checkers that are available for all platforms. On top of that this checker uses Tor for its proxy methods meaning you don't have to find/pay for proxies in order to use this. Essentially making it "proxyless" for the end-user.
  
  ## How to Use SkidChecker.
  First you must purchase SkidChecker from ~https://skidchecker.com/~. Once this is complete you will be able to login to SkidChecker once the program is run. From there you will be able to load your combolist and from there you just hit enter and let it work it's magic. Depending on your internet speeds and the response time between you and the Tor network your speeds may vary. However, this program is designed to run faster than all other checkers available, at least with a good internet connection.
